Welcome to the first update (second update) of my **Bloons TD 5 Flash** mod! Before we get into changes. I want to say the first addition to this mod (instead of reworking):

# Tower Changes
## Additions
### Glue Gunner
- **Bloon Liquefier** drops acid pools after fully popping bloons!
  - The puddles deal 4 damage, have 5 pierce, and last for 10 seconds. They can damage all Bloon types and can target Camo Bloons even  without Camo detection.

# Fun Fact
This was the update where I accidentally deleted the entire scripts folder lol. All in the name of learning tho. As of now I have 2 backups in case I fuck up (in which I would, 100%, no doubts).
