Welcome to the first update (second version) of my **Bloons TD 5 Flash** mod! Before we get into changes. I want to say the first addition to this mod (instead of *changes*, *changes* and more *changes*):

# Tower Changes
## Additions
### Glue Gunner
- **Bloon Liquefier** drops acid pools occasionally, even while attacking!
  - The puddles deal 4 damage, have 5 pierce, and last for 10 seconds. They can damage all Bloon types but cannot target Camo Bloons without Camo detection.

## Reworks
### Glue Gunner Specialist Building
- The tier 3 effect now allows the glue to stun bloons for 0.5 seconds when glued bloons get popped.

## Balance Changes
### Bomb Shooter
- **Cluster Bombs** main explosion damage increased from 1 → 2
- **Bloon Impact**
  - Main explosion stun duration increased from 0.5s → 1.5s
  - Main explosion damage increased from 1 → 4
  - Secondary explosion damage increased from 1 → 2

# Fun Fact
This was the update where I accidentally deleted the entire scripts folder lol. All in the name of learning tho. As of now I have 2 backups in case I fuck up (in which I would, 100%, no doubts).
## Update
I fucked up. (I told you I would)
