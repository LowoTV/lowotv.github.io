# Fun Fact
When I was working on this, I accidentally deleted the entire scripts folder lol. Luckily there weren't many changes in this update. That and: 1. The changes are above bru so i can re-create them. 2. The most annoying ones to redo are always saved by me lol. <span style="font-size: 66.667%;">~~Phew!~~</span>
